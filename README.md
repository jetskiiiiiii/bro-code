# BRO-CODE

Two brothers coding.

## Projects:

- Tic Tac Toe
  - title at the top
  - 9 tiles
  - x goes first
  - should detect win or draw
  - display if x or o wins

  - Python basics
  - OOP
    - Classes
      - /_/_init__ constructor
      - Dunder methods
        - /_/_str__
        - /_/_len__
      - Class & static methods (for encapsulation)
  - Libraries
  - GUI
    - Tkinter (A_Practical_Introduction_to_Python_Programming_Heinold pg. 153-158)
  - Separating files
- Daily Work Log
- 

## Progress:
- Day 5:
  - Work on TTT canvas and impelement win/turn logic
  - Brute force programming

- Day 4:
  - Made Tkinter application that converts an amount in USD to IDR (Indonesian Rupiah) and displays the result.
    - USD to IDR Conversion: Converts USD to IDR using a fixed rate (1 USD = 16,000 IDR).
    - Text Widget: Displays the converted IDR amount.
    - Entry Widget: Allows the user to input the USD amount.
    - Submit Button: Triggers the conversion and updates the Text widget.
    - Exit Button: Closes the application.
- Day 3: Python environments, git workflow, create tic tac toe basic logic
- Day 2: Understand overall goal (what resume should look like, why academic potential has been reached, why PBL is key, career trajectory, importance of internships)
- Day 1: Initialize git repo

## To do:

- Re-factor code
  - Implement loops
  - Implement clases
- Classes for tiles
- Classes for markers
- Classes for game logic
- Go over vs code workflow, shortcuts
- Go over project 1
- Learn vim
